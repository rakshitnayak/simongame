# simongame
#### The Simon game is a classic electronic memory game that tests a player's ability to remember and repeat sequences of colors and tones. It consists of a console with four colored buttonsâ€”traditionally red, blue, green, and yellow. The game produces a sequence of tones and lights by lighting up these buttons in a specific order. Players then have to replicate the sequence by pressing the buttons in the same order. With each successful round, the sequence gets longer and more challenging. It's a great game for testing and improving memory and concentration skills!
